            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am deeply passionate about coding, technology, and cybersecurity, desire to understand. Ever since I was young, I was interested by computers, and I've channeled that passion into building a career centered around the programming and the  security and integrity of data. My passion lies in solving complex problems, implementing secure coding practices, and staying ahead of evolving threats in the ever-changing landscape of programming and cybersecurity. I believe that the digital space can only thrive when systems are built securely, and I am committed to contributing to that vision.</p>
           <br>
            <p>At Coding Dojo, I honed my skills in full-stack development, mastering key programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and SQL. The rigorous curriculum not only taught me how to build scalable web applications but also gave me a solid understanding of the critical importance of security in software development. I worked with a range of technologies, including React, Django, and Node.js, and gained hands-on experience implementing RESTful APIs and creating efficient databases. The experience deepened my appreciation for best practices, from data validation to error handling, while sharpening my ability to think critically and solve complex problems in real-time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Building on my passion and technical skills, I pursued the Google Cybersecurity Certificate to deepen my understanding of the cybersecurity field. This comprehensive program taught me crucial concepts such as PKI, MFA, and public key cryptography—skills that are vital to safeguarding networks and systems. I learned how to identify vulnerabilities, implement encryption techniques, and leverage tools like Wireshark and Nmap for penetration testing. The certificate provided me with a solid foundation in essential security practices, from data privacy and risk mitigation to hands-on experience in building secure systems. It was a transformative experience that expanded my technical knowledge and reinforced my commitment to maintaining safe, robust, and secure digital environments.</p>
